# Problem Set 7 -- The Ising Model
- Write a program to simulate the 2-D Ising model using the metropolis algorithm.
- Investigate the behavior of $c_\nu, \chi, m, \zeta$ with respect to the temperature (especially around the critical temp.)
- How did you change the temperature of the simulation system? Is there a way to change the temp that makes the 
code more optimized?
- Assuming that the critical behavior of the heat capacity has a logarithmic singularity,
\[
c_\nu = c_0 ln(|T - T_c|)
\]
calculate the exponents $\nu, \mu, \beta$ and the coefficient $c_0$ by running the program for systems with 
various lengths.
- **Bonus Question**: Make a movie of the system in different temperatures.
