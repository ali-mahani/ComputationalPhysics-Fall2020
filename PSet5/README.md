# Problem Set 5 -- Random Number Generation

## 1 -- Random Number Generator
- In the programming language of your choice, call a function to generate random numbers from 0 to 9.
put this function in a loop of $N$ repetitions and draw the histogram plot of the returned numbers.
If this generator is working correctly, the height of each bin in your histogram should be $N/10$. Is it true?

- Show that the standard deviation from the number above is related to the inverse square root of $N$:

- Can you find any similarities between this exercise and deposition?

## 2 -- Correlation
- Try the previous program with a difference. This time, only take the numbers generated after a number $4$.
Plot Their histogram. Is it uniform?

## 3 -- Central Limit Theorem
- In order to test the Central Limit Theorem, plot the histogram of numbers generated by summing $N$, using your random number generator.
Do this for values of N = [5, 10, 100, 1000]
- What is similar between this exercise and the random walk and the ballistic deposition with relaxation?

## 4 -- Changing the Distribution Function
- Write a generator for random numbers with a Gaussian Distribution and prove that it works by plotting histogram of
generated numbers.
