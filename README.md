# ComputationalPhysics-Fall2020

This repository contains my assignments for the ComputationalPhysics Course in Fall 2020 semester.

## Structure
The repository consists of directories for different problem sets and the midterm and final exams. 
Inside each PSet directory you will find and `README.md` file containing the Problems, all translated
to English and some necessary instructions on the structure of the subdirectories.
